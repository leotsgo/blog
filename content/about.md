# Hello! I'm Leo, a Software Engineer and SRE from Brazil!


I started my career in a CRM startup, where I worked as a Full Stack Software Engineer. With a small team on the Integrations Squad, I started to learn about Reliability and DevOps practices out of necessity, which lead me to a job as a Site Reliability Engineer in one of brazillian's largest banks.

Aside from work you may find me fiddling with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/leotsgo/dotfiles) ~_which are due to a rework pls send hlp_~. I love neovim and arch linux ~~btw~~, even though I spend most of my time in Ubuntu in my work computer.

If you wanna know what I'm up to these days, please click [here]({{< relref "/now" >}}).

To contact me, just go to my [contact page]({{< relref "/contact" >}})
